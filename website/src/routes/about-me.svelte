<p>Hello world! My name is <span class="text-accent">Sasha</span> (short from Alexander) and I am a full stack software engineer. I am about to complete a Bachelor in Aerospace Engineering at the Technical University of Delft (TU Delft). Software engineering is my career, my passion and my hobby. I wish to use it to make a positive social impact on the world around me.</p>
<p>I am interested in the following applications of software engineering:</p>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside">
  <li>Smart management of power grids, to bring about the energy transition</li>
  <li>Communication and data-gathering satellites</li>
  <li>Medical applications</li>
  <li>Scientific research</li>
</ul>
<p>Please reach out to me, if you believe you have a project which would suit one of my above stated interests and are in need of a quick-learning, independent and ambitious software engineer.</p>
<p>Techno and losing myself on the dance floor is what I like to do in my spare time.</p>
