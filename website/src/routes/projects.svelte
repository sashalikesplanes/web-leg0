		<h3 class="card-title">CudiZone</h3>
		<p>
A web application to enable two people to stream a torrent together with synchronised playback while participating in a video chat. It consists of a server downloading a torrent file and streaming it to the clients, and a WebSocket messaging server to allow the playback synchronisation and WebRTC signalling. It is deployed on a virtual machine on DigitalOcean.</p>

		<h3 class="card-title">Preliminary Aircraft Design Tool</h3>
		<p>
			A software model designed to solve for the optimal aircraft design given a set of constraints.
			The model iterates over all the considered aircraft subsystems updating their parameters in
			order to satisfy the constraints due to all other subsystems, until convergence.

		<h3 class="card-title">Neural Network Classification of Human Control Inputs</h3>
		<p>A data-set gathered during an independent expriment on human subjects. The data-set was cleaned, processed and labelled. Next a DNN classifier was applied to the data-set in order to investigate its performance, and discover future applications for it. A scientific paper was written summarasing the findinings.</p>
